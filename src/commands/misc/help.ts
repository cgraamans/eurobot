**WHAT IS EUROBOT**

Eurobot functions as the provider and publication of news and information for Forum Gotterfunken. 

**What is Forum Gotterfunken**

Forum Gotterfunken is an EU-OSINT Server on Discord. EU-OSINT stands for European Union - Open Source Intelligence. We aim to provide up to date news and information regarding events in and around the EU from a European Perspective.

Please read the #introduction and adhere to the #rules, say hello in #introduce-yourself and come hang out in #general. 

For serious EU and geopolitical news visit the "Serious Effort" category channels like #serious-effort and #geopolitics.

**Roles**

\`\`\`
	/country - list countries
	/country <country name> - add/remove country role.

	/EUGroup - list European Parliamentary Groups you can support
	/EUGroup <parliamentary group name> - add/remove group role
\`\`\`

Note: 
Since this is an EU server, EU countries are represented with roles. Non-EU citizens are of course welcome and can join an European Parliamentary Group or add the non-eu country role.

**Special Commands**
\`\`\`
	/help - this help

	/news - get hot subreddit news
	/latest - latest subreddit news
	/calendar - list calendar entries
\`\`\`
